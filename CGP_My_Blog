<p> <strong>A Growing Need</strong>

<br>
<br>

In light of what we have seen recently in the media as it relates to the Russian hack along with many incidences of data breach, there is definitely a need to create a diverse workforce to tackle such attacks. Before the “technological explosion”, there were fewer incidences of identity theft and data breaches. And while doing business online has made life more convenient in many ways, it has in more ways than one put people's personal identifiable information at risk. Of course, I do agree that there are more advantages than disadvantages to using the internet, however, the disadvantages have left many devastated to say the least.

<p3> <strong> Reading Fiction Improves Brain Connectivity and Function</strong>

<br>
<br>

Neuroscientists have discovered that reading a novel can improve brain function on a variety of levels. The recent study on the brain benefits of reading fiction was conducted at Emory University. The study titled, Short- and Long-Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain," was recently published in the journal Brain Connectivity.The researchers found that becoming engrossed in a novel enhances connectivity in the brain and improves brain function. Interestingly, reading fiction was found to improve the reader's ability to put themselves in another persons shoes and flex the imagination in a way that is similar to the visualization of a muscle memory in sports.
